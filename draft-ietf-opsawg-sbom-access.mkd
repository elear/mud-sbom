--- abstract

To improve cybersecurity posture, automation is necessary to locate
what software is running on a device, whether that software has known
vulnerabilities, and what, if any recommendations suppliers may have.
This memo specifies a model to provide access this information.  It
may optionally be discovered through manufacturer usage descriptions.

--- middle

Introduction
============

A number of activities have been working to improve visibility to what
software is running on a system, and what vulnerabilities that
software may have.

Put simply, we seek to answer two classes of questions **at scale**:

 - Is this system vulnerable to a particular vulnerability?
 - Which devices in a particular environment contain vulnerabilities
   that require some action?

Software bills of material (SBOMs) are descriptions of what software,
including versioning and dependencies, a device contains.  There
are different SBOM formats such as Software Package Data Exchange
{{SPDX}} or CycloneDX{{CycloneDX12}}.

System vulnerabilities may similarly be described using several data
formats, including the aforementioned CycloneDX, Common Vulnerability
Reporting Framework {{CVRF}}, the Common Security Advisory Format {{CSAF}}.
This information is typically used to report to customers the state of
a system.

These two classes of information can be used in concert.  For
instance, a network management tool may discover that a system makes
use of a particular software component that has a known vulnerability,
and a vulnerability report may be used to indicate what if any
versions of software correct that vulnerability, or whether the system
exercises the vulnerable code at all.

Both classes of information elements are optional under the
model specified in this memo.  One can provide only an SBOM, only
vulnerability information, or both an SBOM and vulnerability
information.

This memo specifies means by which both SBOMs and vulnerability
information can be advertised and retrieved through the use of a YANG
augmentation of the Manufacturer User Description (MUD) model
{{!RFC8520}}.  Note that the schema creates a grouping that can also
be used independently of MUD.

The mechanisms specified in this document are meant to satisfy several
use cases:

* A network-layer management system retrieving information from an IoT
  device as part of its ongoing lifecycle. Such devices may or may not
  have query interfaces available.

* An application-layer management system retrieving vulnerability or
  SBOM information in order to evaluate the posture of an application
  server of some form.  These application servers may themselves be
  containers or hypervisors.  Discovery of the topology of a server is
  beyond the scope of this memo.

To satisfy these two key use cases, objects may be found in one of
three ways:

* on devices themselves
* on a web site (e.g., via URI)
* through some form of out-of-band contact with the supplier.

In the first case, devices will have interfaces that permit direct
retrieval.  Examples of these interfaces might be an HTTP, COAP
or {{OpenC2}} endpoint for retrieval.  There may also be private
interfaces as well.

In the second case, when a device does not have an appropriate
retrieval interface, but one is directly available from the
manufacturer, a URI to that information must be discovered.

In the third case, a supplier may wish to make an SBOM or
vulnerability information available under certain circumstances, and
may need to individually evaluate requests.  The result of that
evaluation might be the SBOM or vulnerability itself or a restricted
URL or no access.

To enable application-layer discovery, this memo defines a well-known
URI {{!RFC8615}}.  Management or orchestration tools can query this
well-known URI to retrieve a system's SBOM or vulnerability
information.  Further queries may be necessary based on the content
and structure of the response.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{RFC8174}} when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

Cases Not Addressed
-------------------
\[ This section to be removed prior to publication \]

A separate use case may be addressed in future versions of this document:

* Related to the application layer, software as a service may
  involve multiple backend systems, depending on many factors.
  One example might be a large cloud-based service that offers
  spreadsheets, email, and document authoring and management.
  Depending on what service is being used, a different set of
  back end services may in turn be invoking different software
  that should be listed.

The reason why this use case isnâ€™t addressed here is that it may be
better addressed inline within HTML.  Further discussion is required.

How This Information Is Retreived
---------------------------------

For devices that can emit a URL or can establish a well-known URI, the
mechanism may be highly automated.  For devices that have a URL in
either their documentation or within a QR code on a box, the mechanism
is semi-automated (someone has to scan the QR code or enter the URL).

Note that vulnerability and SBOM information is likely to  change at
different rates.  The MUD semantics provide a way for manufacturers
to control how often tooling should check for those changes through
the cache-validity node.

Formats
------------
There are multiple ways to express both SBOMs and vulnerability
information.  When these are retrieved either directly from the device
or directly from a web server, tools will need to observe the
content-type header to determine precisely which format is being
transmitted.  Because IoT devices in particular have limited
capabilities, use of a specific Accept: header in HTTP or the Accept
Option in CoAP is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Instead, backend tooling MUST
silently discard SBOM information sent with a media type that is not
understood.

Discussion points
-----------------
The following is discussion to be removed at time of RFC publication.

 * Is the model structured correctly?
 * Are there other retrieval mechanisms that need to be specified?
 * Do we need to be more specific in how to authenticate and retrieve
   SBOMs?
 * What are the implications if the MUD URL is an extension in a certificate
   (e.g. an IDevID cert)?


The .well-known/transparency endpoint set
=================================

Two well known endpoints are defined:

 - "/.well-known/transparency/sbom" retrieves an SBOM
 - "/.well-known/transparency/vuln" retrieves vulnerability information.

As discussed previously, the precise format is based on the
Content-type provided in the response.


The mud-transparency extension model extension
======================================

We now formally define this extension.  This is done in two parts.
First, the extension name "transparency" is listed in the "extensions"
array of the MUD file.  N.B., this schema extension is intended to be
used wherever it might be appropriate (e.g., not just MUD).

Second, the "mud" container is augmented with a list of SBOM sources.

This is done as follows:

~~~~~~~~~
module: ietf-mud-transparency

  augment /mud:mud:
    +--rw transparency
       +--rw (sbom-retrieval-method)?
       |  +--:(cloud)
       |  |  +--rw sboms* [version-info]
       |  |     +--rw version-info    string
       |  |     +--rw sbom-url?       inet:uri
       |  +--:(local-well-known)
       |  |  +--rw sbom-local-well-known?   enumeration
       |  +--:(sbom-contact-info)
       |     +--rw sbom-contact-uri         inet:uri
       +--rw (vuln-retrieval-method)?
          +--:(cloud)
          |  +--rw vulns* [version-info]
          |     +--rw version-info    string
          |     +--rw vuln-url?       inet:uri
          +--:(vuln-local-well-known)
          |  +--rw vuln-local-well-known?   enumeration
          +--:(vuln-contact-info)
             +--rw contact-uri              inet:uri

In this example MUD file that uses a cloud service, the Frobinator
presents a location of the SBOM in a URL.  Note, the ACLs in a MUD
file are NOT required, although they are a very good idea for IP-based
devices.  The first MUD file demonstrates how to get the SBOM without
ACLs, and the second has ACLs.

At this point, the management system can attempt to retrieve the SBOM,
and determine which format is in use through the content-type header
on the response to a GET request.

Security Considerations
=======================
SBOMs provide an inventory of software.  If firmware is available to
an attacker, the attacker may well already be able to derive this very
same software inventory.  Manufacturers MAY restrict access to SBOM
information using appropriate authorization semantics within HTTP.  In
particular, if a system attempts to retrieve an SBOM via HTTP and the
client is not authorized, the server MUST produce an appropriate
error, with instructions on how to register a particular client.  One
example may be to issue a certificate to the client for this purpose
after a registration process has taken place.  Another example would
involve the use of OAUTH in combination with a federations of SBOM
servers.

Another risk is a skew in the SBOM listing and the actual software 
inventory of a device/container. For example, a manufacturer may update
the SBOM on its server, but an individual device has not be upgraded yet. 
This may result in an incorrect policy being applied to a device. A unique mapping of a device's firmware version and its SBOM can 
minimize this risk.

To further mitigate attacks against a device, manufacturers SHOULD
recommend access controls through the normal MUD mechanism.


IANA Considerations
===================

MUD Extension
-------------

The IANA is requested to add "controller-candidate" to the MUD
extensions registry as follows:

~~~~~~~

  Extension Name: sbom
  Standard reference: This document

~~~~~~~

Well-Known Prefix
-----------------

The following well known URI is requested in accordance with
{{!RFC8615}}:

~~~~~~

  URI suffix: "sbom"
  Change controller: "IETF"
  Specification document: This memo
